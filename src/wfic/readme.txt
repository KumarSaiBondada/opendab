This code will take the raw symbol data as transmitted over the USB, and perform the required decoding to extract the FIC.  A similar operation is required to extract the MSC, slighty complicated by the need to dynamically vary the puncturing pattern - but shouldn't be too tricky ...

The required steps are:
    frequency deinterleaving
    symbol demapping
    depuncturing
    viterbi decoding
    descrambling

The code is left very verbose - and so slow, to illustrate the procedure.  It even include some comments ... These steps are implemented in the 'real' software mainly using unrolled mmx code, but the algorithms are pretty simple, so speeding things up should be simple enough.


I've included some sample data to try it out on - but if you want some real data, I've also modified the dabble code to dump out a suitable log file.  Use 'ficdec' (see below) to decode the FIC/FIBs.




dabble
------
I've also included a variant of dabble, that will dump out the raw FIC symbol data, fic.log suitable for use as an input to WFIC.

There are a few #defines in options.h to enable various logging options.

fic decoder
-----------
see http://www.esslinger.de/download/ficdec.htm

This program will interpret the FIC data file, fic.dat generated by WFIC.
