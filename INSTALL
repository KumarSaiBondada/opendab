			    OpenDAB v.0.06

			     Installation

OpenDAB has been developed using a variety of Linux distributions and 
it should compile and install perhaps with minor changes on most 
distributions using the Linux 2.6 kernel.

Pre-requisites:

The following need to be installed in order to complete the build and
installation:

1. gcc - I've been using gcc version gcc version 4.4.3
   make - sometimes it's not installed by default.

2. The header files for the Linux kernel you're currently running.  Either
   you've built the kernel yourself, in which case there's no problem
   or you need to have installed a package containing the kernel
   header files - Fedora has kernel-devel<version>.rpm, Debian has
   linux-kernel-headers - other distributions no doubt have equivalent
   packages.  This is necessary to compile the driver. Maybe later we
   can get a driver included in the Linux kernel.

3. FFTW from www.fftw.org.  I have used fftw-3.2.2.

4. An MP2 player. I've been using mpg321 from mpg321.sourceforge.net.
   The player needs to be able to (a) Cope with DAB frames since these
   aren't yet converted to MP2 format and (b) accept input from stdin.

5. The files "rsDSPa.bin" and "rsDSPb.bin" from the windows software
   for the WaveFinder.  Put these in the same directory as the wf
   executable.

6. A PC of suitable performance.  I don't know what the minimum
   spec needs to be but playing Radio 3 takes about 48% of the CPU
   (according to 'top') on an old 900MHz PIII with 256Mbytes of RAM.
   Services with lower bitrates use correspondingly fewer CPU cycles.
   Using multiple devices will, of course, require more processor
   power. 

7. DAB+ is enabled by default - if you don't disable it then you will
   need to install Phil Karn's fec package (fec-3.0.1) from
   http://ka9q.net/code/fec
   because OpenDAB uses the Reed-Solomon decoder functions provided
   by that package.

   You may find that the fec-3.0.1 package fails to compile on
   ia32 machines with errors like this from gcc:

   fec.h:267: Error: bad register name `%dil'

   If so, then, after unpacking fec-3.0.1, try: 

   cd fec-3.0.1
   patch -p1 < ~/OpenDAB-0.05/patch-fec-3.0.1.txt
   (Change the path if you unpacked OpenDAB-0.05 somewhere else)
   then 'make' again.

   I emailed Phil Karn about this but didn't get a reply.

8. DAB+ playback requires an HE-AAC (AAC+) player.  I've used mplayer
   but it doesn't appear to much like playing from stdin - it seems to 
   be necessary to enable the -cache option but how much to allocate
   seems to be a matter of experimentation.  Feedback on any experiences
   with this or other players would be very useful. 
   


Installation:

(The driver needs to be installed, but the rest of the software
is intended for development purposes so there seemed no point
in installing in /usr/bin etc.)

1. md5sum OpenDAB-0.05.tar.gz should be the same as the
   value posted to the dabusb list.

2. Unpack the distribution: tar zxvf OpenDAB-0.05.tar.gz

3. cd to OpenDAB-0.05

4. If you don't want DAB+ support and wish to avoid having to
   install the fec package then comment out the 'DABPLUS=1' 
   line in src/Makefile.
   Type "make"

5. Install the kernel driver.  Details may vary depending on which distro
   you're using but essentially there are two ways to do this: 

   (a) cd to the "driver" directory, become root and type "/sbin/insmod
       wavefinder.ko" You will probably also need to change the permissions
       of the /dev/wavefinder* devices.
       You'll need to do this after each reboot.

   (b) as root:
       cp driver/wavefinder.ko /lib/modules/[kernel version]/driver/usb/misc

       for Ubuntu 10.04: cp driver/60-wavefinder.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

       for Debian 4.0 etch: cp driver/60-wavefinder.rules /etc/udev/wavefinder.rules
              ln -s /etc/udev/wavefinder.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/60-wavefinder.rules

       (other distros will need something along these lines).

       Run "depmod" (probably /sbin/depmod)
       The driver should be loaded automatically and given the
       permissions specified in the rules file on each
       reboot or re-plug.

6. Copy "rsDSPa.bin" and "rsDSPb.bin" to the src directory

7. To test: cd src; ./wf | mpg321 -q -
   
   (or whatever command is appropriate for your MP2 player).

   See the file README for further information.
